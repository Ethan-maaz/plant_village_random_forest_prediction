Introduction
Plant Disease Detection Using TensorFlow and Google Colab is a deep learning project aimed at identifying and classifying diseases in plants from images. This project leverages TensorFlow for building and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and utilizes Google Colab for cloud-based training, allowing for efficient model development and experimentation.

Features
Identification and classification of plant diseases from images.
Utilization of state-of-the-art CNN architectures for accurate disease detection.
Easy access to powerful GPU resources through Google Colab for faster training.
Support for various plant species and disease types.
Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset of plant images with associated disease labels. Some popular datasets for plant disease detection include:

PlantVillage Dataset
Kaggle Plant Pathology Dataset
Ensure to preprocess the dataset appropriately before training.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
Google Colab account (for cloud-based training)
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant-disease-detection
Set up Google Colab environment:

Upload the dataset to Google Drive.
Open the Plant_Disease_Detection.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
Mount Google Drive and set the path to the dataset accordingly.
Usage
Open the Plant_Disease_Detection.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model.
Evaluate the trained model and make predictions on new images.
Training
Configure the notebook settings for GPU acceleration.
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Define and compile the CNN model architecture.
Train the model using the training dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset.
Fine-tune the model if necessary.
Inference
After training the model, you can make predictions on new plant images using the trained model weights. Follow the inference steps provided in the notebook.

Results
Include sample results of disease detection showcasing the model's performance on various plant images. Visualize the model predictions and evaluate its accuracy.
